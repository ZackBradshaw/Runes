# Runes

![Runes Banner](https://example.com/path/to/banner.jpg)

Runes is a Python package that enables developers and designers to generate and map user-defined pseudo-code to various coding systems. This includes integration with LangChain for natural language processing, facilitating the creation of pseudo-code through conversational AI.

## Installation

```bash
pip install runes
```

## Features

- **User-Defined Syntax**: Define your own pseudo-code syntax using emojis, ASCII art, or any textual representation.
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilize natural language processing to generate pseudo-code and map it directly other languages eg: Unreal Engine blueprints.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extend `Runes` to support new coding systems beyond Unreal Engine blueprints.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Create a JSON configuration file to define your syntax mappings. Here's an example for Unreal Engine blueprints:

```json
{
  "syntaxMappings": {
    "üöÄ": "Event",
    "‚û°Ô∏è": "Execution Flow",
    "‚ú®": "Function Call",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Generating Blueprint Code with Natural Language

`Runes` integrates with LangChain to allow you to define pseudo-code through natural language. Here's how to get started:

```python
from runes.langchain_integration import generate_pseudo_code
from runes.extensions.unreal_blueprint import UnrealBlueprintMapper

# Generate pseudo-code from natural language
pseudo_code = generate_pseudo_code("Create an event that increments score when an item is collected")

# Load your syntax configuration
unreal_mapper = UnrealBlueprintMapper('path/to/config.json')

# Map the generated pseudo-code to Unreal Engine blueprint
blueprint_code = unreal_mapper.map_to_blueprint(pseudo_code)
print(blueprint_code)
```

## Example Project

To see `Runes` in action, check out the [Bluepy Project on GitHub](https://github.com/ZackBradshaw/Bluepy), which demonstrates how you can use `Runes` to generate Unreal Engine blueprint code from user-defined pseudo-code.

## Extending Runes

To support additional coding systems, create a module in the `extensions` directory. See `unreal_blueprint.py` for an example.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're adding new features, improving documentation, or extending support for other languages, your help is appreciated.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement dynamic LSP for auto-complete functionality.
- [ ] Integrate alternative syntax extensions

### Implementation Notes

1. **Banner Image**: Ensure the banner image URL is valid and publicly accessible. Replace `https://example.com/path/to/banner.jpg` with the actual URL of the banner image you wish to use.

2. **LangChain Integration**: The example code snippet assumes the existence of a `langchain_integration` module within the `Runes` package. This module should handle communication with LangChain APIs to facilitate natural language processing and generation of pseudo-code.

3. **Project Link**: The provided link to the [Bluepy Project](https://github.com/ZackBradshaw/Bluepy) should point to an actual GitHub repository that demonstrates the use of `Runes` for Unreal Engine blueprint generation. Ensure the repository exists and is public.

4. **Extensibility and Contributions**: The README encourages contributions and extensions to the `Runes` package, aiming to create a community-driven tool that supports a wide range of coding systems.

By incorporating these updates, the `Runes` package README now offers a comprehensive guide to its features, usage, and extension, making it accessible for both developers and non-developers interested in leveraging AI for code generation.
